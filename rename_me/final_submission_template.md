> Give a brief description of the final product:
> We concluded all our member's events count for each course, and also 1. (plot the bar chart for events distribution by hour of the day) and 2.(plot the pie chart for distribution of working time by weekdays versus weekends) and 3.(plot the bar chart for distribution of events counts by day of the day). We also investigated which factor influences the final grade of a student.

# Reflection
## Approach
> What was your approach to the dataset? What problem did you want to solve? What technology did you decide to use? How did your team split the work?
> We use Python/R to mine the data to find patterns. We investigate the time pattern of University students' time spent on studies and also explore the most influencing factor to the final grade of a student.

## Wins / Challenges
> Describe some wins/challenges. What did you learn? What would you do differently next time?
> The challenge that we faced was data wrangling, in which we combined and organized different data frames into one for later analysis and interpretation, furthermore, it is quite time-consuming to find a strong correlation between some of the features and target--grade. With our strong foundation on the LM model, we found that the mean grades of students were highly related to their participation in the course and understanding shown in the discussion board. Next time, we will try our best to fit all features into one data frame, then use multiple models to examine it, in order to get the model that is best for the data set, which we will be able to predict new data with high accuracy.
